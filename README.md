AdminID
==========================

This is a basic admin HTML template partially based on [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE). It's optimised to work with [Hammer for mac](http://hammerformac.com/) and Sass.

## Includes:

* Bootstrap Sass v3.3.1
* Jquery
* Modernizr 2.6.2

## Gettin started:

### Option 1. With  [Hammer for mac](http://hammerformac.com/).

Download the repo and drag it into Hammer.

### Option 2. Without [Hammer for mac](http://hammerformac.com/).

If you donâ€™t use Hammer, use just the files in Build folder.

## Directories

* `/assets` - contains source files (scss, js, images and fonts) that should be compiled into Build folder.
* `/Build` - contains all compiled and processed files.
* `/includes` - include template partials like _head.html, _footer.html etc.
* `/pages` - contains source files for page examples (including hammer variables).
